# Process Twin AI Dashboard

Research prototype: a simulated operational process (order intake → scheduling → explanation → human override) for a small service company, built to explore how AI can support — not replace — operational decisions.

**Status:** Stage A complete (synthetic orders, heuristic scheduler, live dashboard board). Stage B in progress: AI explanations are wired up (`GET /api/orders/:id/explanation`); human override is not built yet.

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the full project context, constraints, research questions, and development plan (Stage A–D).

## Structure

```
server/   Express + SQLite backend (routes/controllers/services/repositories, once added)
web/      React + Vite + Tailwind dashboard
```

## Quickstart

### Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

Runs on `http://localhost:3001`. `GET /health` → `{"status":"ok"}`.

### Frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

```bash
cd server
npm test
```

## Research questions

See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md#2-исследовательские-вопросы). A dedicated README section with results is planned for Stage C, once there is decision history to report on.

## AI explanations

`GET /api/orders/:id/explanation` calls Claude (`claude-opus-5` — the skill-mandated default; override in `server/services/explanationService.js` if you want a cheaper model for this route) to explain a scheduled order's assignment in plain language, grounded only in the same inputs the scheduler itself used (deadline, order type's priority bonus, specialist availability/queue position) — no invented "priority" or "VIP" fields. Structured output is enforced via `client.messages.parse()` + a Zod schema, not manual `JSON.parse()`.

Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `server/.env`. Without it (or if the call fails for any reason), the endpoint degrades to a deterministic template built from the same raw factors — `confidence: "low"`, `source: "fallback"` — instead of a 500. Fallback responses aren't cached, so the next call retries the LLM; real explanations are cached in the `explanations` table (see `server/db/migrations/004_explanations.sql`).

## Known limitations (Stage A/B)

- No authentication — single-tenant, permissive CORS, not a production posture.
- Scheduler is a deterministic heuristic (earliest-deadline-first + type priority), not a learned model — see `server/services/schedulingService.js`.
- Scheduler ignores specialists' `hours_per_day` and day/working-hours boundaries; treats them as available back-to-back from the reference time.
- No human override yet — accepting/overriding a plan and logging the decision is the next Stage B piece.
